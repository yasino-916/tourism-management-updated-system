3.  Configure Environment Variables:
    *   Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`.
    *   Update database credentials (`DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`) inside `.env` to match your local setup.
4.  Start the Backend Server:
    *   **Windows (PowerShell)**:
        ```powershell
        .\start_server.ps1
        ```
